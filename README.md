# SocialNetworkAnalysis
Currently non-operable codebase for social science research on social networks. This is going to get updated as I finish implementing it and will be maintained through 2016.

There's a missing class, TwitterAuth, which I can talk to you about if you're interested in working with this code! Email me about it.
