# SocialNetworkAnalysis
Codebase for social science research on social networks. Supports Twitter as of May 3rd, 2016 by using <a href="http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html" target="_blank">Twitter4j</a>.

There's a missing class, TwitterAuth, which I can talk to you about if you're interested in working with this code!

Check out the Applications folder to see what I've used this for.
